# Conrad: a minimalist simulation of evo-devo

Evolutionary-developmental biology (evo-devo) biology is the study of the intertwined relationship between development and evolution.

The combination of. The aim of `Conrad` is to 
Maybe: A cognitive tool for thinking about evo-devo.
* A thinking tool for evo-devo.

* Add: know everything. Control everything.

Plasticity, Robustness, Genetic Drift, Evolvability. 

## What’s in the box?

`Conrad` provides the following:

* Gene Regulation: A Boolean model of gene regulation that generates a discrete time series of Boolean cellular activity.
* Fitness evaluation: Fitness is measure by exposing genes to a variety of different environments and comparing the resulting cellular activity against a specified target.
* Evolution: `Conrad` has a simple asexual model of evolutionary change, with control over population sizes, mutation rates and some aspects of how regulatory binding sites are generated. 
* 2d Multicellular Development: `Conrad` developmental systtem By embedding into the same genes regulatory control in in the form of a simple 2d cellular automaton. `Conrad`Gene regulatory models are wired together, using several signalling models.

Despite the relatively simple combination of features, `Conrad` can be used to generate an wide variety of XXXX: 

* Plasticity. 
* Automatic generation of many different genetic interactions.
* Knockouts can be performed on different 
* Transplanted 
* New populations can be generated


## What is it for?

The evolution and development of multicellular form is one of the most striking processes in the biological world. Understanding the complex interaction between these empirical 

Conrad aim is provides just enough complexity to surface some of the same conceptual problems, but without the same problems of empirical 

My aim in creating `Conrad` were foremost to provide the means to explore conceptual stuff. My main aim is to provide a simulation that is powerful enough to *pose the same conceptual difficulties* in attempting to analyse or explain what is going on.

* One reason (but not the only) that the two first features are so simple, is that it enables relatively rapid evolution (on the order of 100,000s of generations), and does so in parallel.

No doubt there are those who think the simulation could have even less in it; there are certainly simpler attempts to capture evo-devo. Any thoughts or discussions about what could be taken would be great.

## Why does/doesn’t Conrad include *FEATURE X*

Not only are the implementations of these features vastly simplified, there is a great deal that has been left out. There are two reasons for that. The first is pragmatic: more complex models take more time.

I am a philosopher of biology, not a biologist.

## Why “Conrad”?

The name comes from [Conrad H. Waddington][1], a biologist that layed the foundations for many evolutionary developmental biology. He is perhaps well known for the epigenetic landscape. I find Waddington a fascinating figure, XXXX. I hope he would have liked this simulation.
