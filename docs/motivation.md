The evolution and development of multicellular form is one of the most striking subjects in the biological world. The process that undergoes a single fertilized cell as it transforms itself into a jumping, flying, crawling body with limbs, organs, and a brain is unlike human-invented fabrication process. If that were not amazing enough, gradual modifications to this process connect a diversity three-dimensional forms, with xxxxx. Not only is there not a central director of the developmental process, there is no designer guiding the direction of the modifications.

Gathering empirical evidence isn’t all of science, however. There remains a fair amount of controversy about many things in evolutionary developmental biology. In many cases, it is the study of particular animals. What can we say in general?

## What’s missing?

* Gene and cellular activity are Boolean, thus there no capacity for xxx.
* There is no cooperation or any interaction between the organisms (other than selection for relative fitness).
* There is no physics during development.

* One reason (but not the only) that the two first features are so simple, is that it enables relatively rapid evolution (on the order of 100,000s of generations), and does so in parallel.

No doubt there are those who think the simulation could have even less in it; there are certainly simpler attempts to capture evo-devo. Any thoughts or discussions about what could be taken would be great.

## Why does/doesn’t Conrad include *FEATURE X*

Not only are the implementations of these features vastly simplified, there is a great deal that has been left out. There are two reasons for that. The first is pragmatic: more complex models take more time.

* **This isn’t really a minimalist simulation**. That isn’t a really a question. But yes, you are right. There are far simpler models that capture interesting.

* There

 The evolution and development of multicellular form is one of the most striking processes in the biological world. Trying to understand and explain it poses challenges and conceptual puzzles (challenges. it how physical processes over development and evolution interact over all the parts
